<em>Experiment 1</em>
<br><em>Aim:</em> DC,AC,Transient analysis of Common Source NMOS Amplifier</br>
<br><em>Theory:</em></br><p>The common source amplifier in which the input is given to the gate terminal and output is taken from the drain terminal. The source is common to both the input and output. The common source amplifier has 180 degree phase shift.</p></br>
<br><em>Components Required:</em></br>
<br>Resistor:1k ohms, NCMOS transistor(180nm technology), DC power supply</br>
<br><em>Circuit design : </em></br>

<br>**i) DC Analysis**</br>
<br><p> In DC Analysis we determiine the Qpoint or the operating point of the transistor. The Q point is crucial as it influences the amplifier gain and the signal swing.</p></br>

<br>From simulation: V<sub>out</sub>=1.6V , V<sub>in</sub>=0.9V , I<sub>d</sub>=55.5ÂµA.</br>
